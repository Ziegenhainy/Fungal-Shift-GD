# Fungal Shift

Adds Fungal Shifting from Noita. Next to any uploaded level, there is a new fungal shift button that *permanently* shifts reality for that level. This means that anything from spikes, to orbs, to gameplay portals can be changed to completely different objects. This effect is only removed the level is refreshed, and you may stack as many fungal shifts as possible.
